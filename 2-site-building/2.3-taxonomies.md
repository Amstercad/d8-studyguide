# Taxonomies

According to [Drupal.org - Taxonomy](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/structure-taxonomy.html):

> Taxonomy is used to classify website content. One common example of taxonomy is the tags used to classify or categorize posts in a blog website; the farmers market website could use an ingredients taxonomy to classify recipes. Individual taxonomy items are known as terms and a set of terms is known as a vocabulary

> Technically, taxonomy terms are an entity type and the entity subtypes are the vocabularies. Like other entities, taxonomy terms can have fields attached; for instance, you could set up an image field to contain an icon for each term.

> An individual vocabulary can organize its terms in a hierarchy, or it could be flat.

Taxonomy terms are normally attached as __reference fields__ to other content entities to provide categorization of content.
