#### Create and use Taxonomy vocabularies and terms for classification and organization of content

# Taxonomies

According to [Drupal.org - Taxonomy](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/structure-taxonomy.html):

> Taxonomy is used to classify website content. One common example of taxonomy is the tags used to classify or categorize posts in a blog website; the farmers market website could use an ingredients taxonomy to classify recipes. Individual taxonomy items are known as terms and a set of terms is known as a vocabulary

> Technically, taxonomy terms are an entity type and the entity subtypes are the vocabularies. Like other entities, taxonomy terms can have fields attached; for instance, you could set up an image field to contain an icon for each term.

> An individual vocabulary can organize its terms in a hierarchy, or it could be flat.

**Taxonomy terms are normally attached as reference fields to other content entities, which is how you can use them to classify content.**

## Creating Taxonomy

https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/structure-taxonomy-setup.html

### Free tagging

New terms can be created right on the content editing form.

### Fixed list of terms

The list of terms is curated and managed outside the content editing form, and users can only choose from the existing list when editing content.
